# Installation & Setup

> :warning: This addon needs at least Node 6.

To install the addon, run:

```sh
ember install ember-electron
```

Or, to install with npm - but please ensure (:warning:) that the blueprint generation runs - it creates necessary files and configuration for this addon to work. Please ensure that you have a populated `ember-electron` folder at the root of your project, and another one (only containing `lib/index.js`) in your `tests` directory.

```sh
npm install ember-electron
ember g ember-electron
```

See [FAQ: Structure](../faq/structure.md) for more information on the layout of the `ember-electron` directory.
